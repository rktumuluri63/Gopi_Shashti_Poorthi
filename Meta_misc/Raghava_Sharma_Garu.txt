Gopi,

 We have recently been introduced to an astrologer Sri Raghava Sharma garu. This was via Kavitha's extended family. On meeting him, we found him to be easy to communicate and exteremely knowledge-able in our Vedas and Vedic methods. 

 Since then we have consulted him on several occasions, particularly on major issues.

 
 I referred him to Sarru / Ganesh and they have also consulted him. 


 Amma & I visited him today at his home and shared your birth-details. (place of birth - Agra, Time of birth - 3:45 am July 30th, 1965 )

 
He developed it's related "kundali" (Jaatakam ). I will get a hard-copy of this from him asap. 


Based on that he narrated some highs-lows of your life with accuracy that was impressive. This included your time in Abad (stock market issue) and recent health issue (kidney transplant). He also expressed your personality traits (determined, brave ... ). He said u are going thru a very delicate and rough patch and once you are past this you will have several glorious decades. 


I suggest you have a short meeting with him. This can be over "gmeet" / "zoom" etc. If u wish you can have this 1:1 or with Sumana or  I or amma can be present. 

There are solutions to "tide" over the hard times. (Rahu / Ketu influence)
